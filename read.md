<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
This program helps the users in downloading YouTube video using respective URLs. The user can simply copy the URL, select the destination folder and save the file. It was built using python libraries including tkinter and pip packages

<h2><a class="anchor" id="problem"></a>Problem</h2>
Often users interested in downloading a video for editing, etc find it difficult to save the videos quickly. They have to paste the links, convert them using pre-written programs and then the process starts. This program cuts all the steps.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="projec-structure"></a>Project Structure</h2>
simple 1 file program written in python

<h2><a class="anchor" id="key-things"></a>Key Things</h2>
The program can throw errors if the user is not using latest version of python libraries and protocal versions

<h2><a class="anchor" id="how-to-run-this-program"></a>How to run this program</h2>
-- Load it in a terminal
-- run the code
-- paste YouTube video URL
-- select destination folder
-- sitback and enjoy as the video is downloaded

<h2><a class="anchor" id="recommendations"></a>Recommendations</h2>
A better way to build this program is importing the yt_dlp library and saving the video using ffmpeg format, which downloads the video in different parts but saves it as 1 file. This method is slightly complex VS the pytube library but the pytube API can misbehave with frequent updates leading to errors in the program.
